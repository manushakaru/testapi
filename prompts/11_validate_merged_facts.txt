       **Task:**
       You are given a list of merged facts between #### delimiters. 
       These merged facts are generated by merging relevant facts.
       But still, there might be some errors in the merged facts. However, there might be potential errors in the merged facts.
       Your task is to identify all possible errors in the merged facts and provide a list of errors.
       Follow the below guidelines to make accurate output. 

       **Guidelines:**
       - Verify if all data points from the relevant facts are accurately included in the merged fact. 
       - Validate the data points in the merged data and provide errors of the data. For example, if the data value is wrong compared to the fact data, then give an error. 
       - Give an error if the merged_data has different units. 
       - Give an error if the merged_content do not cover all the neccesory details from the relevant facts. It should make a summary of all the related facts with numerical values. 
       - Validate the data point values with the units resprect to the original values. For example 300 million should be 300 in value and million in units. It should not be like value 300,000,000 and unit millions. 
       - Validate the visualization recommendation
              - Give an error if the vis recommendation is not suitability to the data. Here are some example recommendations for data type. There are many other ways as well. So make your decision wisely. 
                     -  Time series → Line chart
                     -  Categorical comparison → Bar chart
                     -  Distribution → Pie chart or Bar chart
                     -  Ranking → Bar chart
                     -  Part-to-Whole → Pie chart or Isotype chart
              - Give an error if all the data points can not be encoded into one visualization 
              - Give an error if the recommendation is pie chart and the units are percentages and sum of the values are not 100% 
              - Give an error if the data points have different units 
              - Give an error if the data points have two or more same labels 
              - Give an error if the recommendation is line chart and data points are in a range according to the narrative. 
       - If the chart title exceed 40 characters give an error
       - If x-axis title exceed 20 characters give an error
       - If y-axis title exceed 20 characters give an error
       - If label in merged_data exceed 15 characters give  an error
       - Validate the merged_data labels and x-axis title. If the labels contain common words (e.g., "revenue 2021" and "revenue 2022" both share "revenue"), suggest using the common words in the x-axis title and raise an error indicating that the labels can be simplified. The error should containg remove the word from label and include in the axis title. 
       - If the merged fact creates illogical or confusing relationships between data points — report it as Illogical Merging Error and suggest solution as split the merged fact.
       - If the merged fact combines unrelated data points without clear justification — report it as Irrelevant Merging Error and suggest solution as split the merged fact.
       - Refer the given examples below.

       **Examples** 
       Input visulaization data : 
       "merged_data": [
                    {
                        "label": "x",

                        "label": "y",
                        "value": "50",
                        "unit": "%"
                    }
                ],
                "merged_recommendation": "pie",
       Error: "To recommend a pie chart percentages in data points should be sum up to 100%"

       "merged_data": [
                    {
                        "label": "x",
                        "value": "40",
                        "unit": "student"
                    },
                    {

                        "unit": "%"
                    }
                ],
                "merged_recommendation": "pie",
       Error: "Cannot merge data points in different units and wrong recommendation"
