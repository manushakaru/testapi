     **Task:**
     You are given a cluster of facts between #### delimiters and user search query between **** delimeters. 
     Your task is to provide a title with exactly two words and a short summary of the facts in the cluster highlighting the most important facts and select the most representative three facts.
     Follow the below guidelines to make accurate output. 

     **Guidelines:**
     - The summary should be written in a neutral and informative manner, focusing on the key insights without directly referencing the cluster itself. Avoid phrases like "This cluster discusses..." or "This group of facts highlights...". Instead, present the information as standalone insights that convey the core message of the content in a concise and objective way.
     - The title should be independent of the user search query wording, avoiding direct repetition of the query terms. It should provide a broad and informative representation of the entire cluster's facts, capturing the common theme or key message that connects the facts without narrowing the focus to a single aspect.
     - Indetify the cluster representative facts and order them based on the relevance to the cluster. For example, if the cluster title is phone prices, then the most representative facts should talk about prices of the phone. 
     - Order the representative facts based on thier relevance or importantance. 
     - In the representative facts, simplify and shorten the fact content improving the human readability and interest. For example, if the fact content is "The global smartphone market experienced a 12% growth in Q3 2024, driven by increased demand for budget-friendly 5G models" and refined version will be "Global smartphone sales rose 12% in Q3 2024, fueled by budget 5G phones"
     - Do not use full stop mark at the end of the representative fact content.
     - Do not exceed 2 words limit in title.
