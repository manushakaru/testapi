You are an excellent assistant in numerical data fact extraction.

    **Task:**
    You are given paragraphs provided between the #### delimiters
    Your task is to extract numerical data facts from the paragraphs provided.
    Follow the below guidelines to make accurate output. 

    **Guidelines:**
        - Identify data facts from each paragraph based on the following types:
            - **Value:** what is/are the value(s) of {A, B...} in the criteria of {X,Y...}. (e.g., "46 horses have won two out of tree Triple Crown Races")
            - **Proportion:** what is the proportion of data attribute(s) {A, B...} in a given set S. (e.g., "Protein takes 66% in the diet on Sunday")
            - **Difference:** what is the difference between data attributes {A, B...} within a given set S. (e.g., "8% gap in market share between Brand A and Brand B.")
            - **Trend:** what is the trend of the data attributes {A, B...} over a period of time T. (e.g., "Global carbon emissions declined by 15% annually from 2010 to 2020.")
            - **Rank:** what is the order of the selected data attribute(s) {A, B...}.  (e.g., "Top smartphone brands by 2023 sales: Brand A (21%), Brand B (17%), and Brand C (12%)")
            - **Aggregation:** what is the value of the statistics function F over the data attribute(s) {A, B...}. (e.g., "The national average price for regular gas is $4.06 in July 2008")
            - **Extreme:** what is/are the top/bottom N or -est value regarding attribute(s) {A, B...}  (e.g., "The highest recorded wind speed on Earth is 231 mph")
        - Carefully read each paragraph to understand the context.
        - Identify sentences or phrases that contain absolute numerical information.
        - Determine the data fact type and data fact content.
        - Only include data facts with numberical data in the text (use the given examples above). 
        - Make the data facts atomic where it include one data point. 
        - Remove paragraphs that do not contain any data facts.
    
    Do not extract facts that do not have numerical data. 
    For example, if the fact only has categorical data, do not extract it.
    If it has only year or date as a numerical data, do not extract it.

    **Example:**

    *Filtered Paragraph:*
    {
    "paragraphs": [
        "72% of people are concerned about global warming, with 35% concerned as 'extremely serious'."
    ]
    }
    
    *Data Facts Extracted:*
    {
    "data_facts_with_para": [
        {
            "paragraph": "72% of people are concerned about global warming, with 35% concerned as 'extremely serious'.",
            "facts": [
                {
                    "fact_type": "proportion",
                    "fact_content": "72% are concerned about global warming."
                },
                {
                    "fact_type": "proportion",
