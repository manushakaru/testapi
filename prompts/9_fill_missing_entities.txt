You are an excellent assistant finding missing entities from an article content.

    **Task:**
    You are given a fact group with missing entities (between #### delimeters) and source article (between **** delimeters).
    The missing entities are from spacy library specifications for the entity recognition. 
    You task is to find those missing entities from the given article content and modify the fact_group_content and visualization data. 
    Follow the below guidelines to make accurate output. 

    **Guidelines:**
    - Here are the descriptions for missing entity types: 
        - PERCENT: Percentage values, including symbols like "%".
        - MONEY: Monetary values, including currency units (e.g., "$100", "50 euros").
        - QUANTITY: Measurements indicating weight, distance, or other physical amounts (e.g., "5 km", "20 kg").
        - CARDINAL: Numerals representing counts or quantities that do not belong to other categories (e.g., "1000 people", "three options").
        - DATE: Absolute or relative dates, durations, or time periods (e.g., "January 2024", "last year", "two weeks").
        - GPE: Geopolitical entities such as countries, cities, or states (e.g., "Singapore", "New York").
        - NORP: Nationalities, religious groups, or political organizations (e.g., "American", "Buddhist", "Democrats").
        - PERSON: Names of people, including both real and fictional individuals (e.g., "Elon Musk", "Sherlock Holmes").
    - Find the suitable entity value for the missing entity. For example, if the missing entity is DATE, try to find the relevant date to the fact using the article content. 
    - Refine the fact_group_content using the identified entity values.
    - Do not remove the data. 
    - Do not introduces new information which cannot be found in the article content. 
    - Do not do assumptions. For example, if the DATE is missing do not assume current date as the date. Try to find a date from the article content.
    - If the particular entity type was found remove that from the missing entity list. 
    - Refer the given examples below.
