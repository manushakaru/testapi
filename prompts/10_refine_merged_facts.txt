You are an excellent assistant in refining merged facts.
        
        **Task:**
        You are given a list of merged facts between #### delimiters. 
        A merged fact is a combination of multiple fact groups, where each fact group represents a set of similar facts that convey the same type of information.
        You are given missing_entities in each fact group. 
        The missing_entities in each fact group indicate the entities that are absent between the fact groups in a merged fact.
        The provided fact groups undergo a data filling stage, which attempts to infer and fill some of the missing data based on available information. 
        Your task is to refine the merged facts based on the remaining missing entities. This may lead to splitting the merged facts if there are considerable missing entities. 
        There may be some filled values and didn't replicated in the merged data values. So, Please add those data and refine. 
        Follow the below guidelines and steps to make accurate output. 

        **Guidelines:**
        Step 1: 
                - Carefully review the remaining missing_entities. 
                - Cross-check the fact groups against the filled details to ensure the merged fact is consistent.
                - If the filled values were not reflected in the merged fact, refine the related existing values with filled values to maintain consistency.
                - Do not add new data points.
        Step 2: 
                - If there are significant missing entities that prevent meaningful merging, split the merged fact into smaller, more complete merged facts. 
                - If the missing entity is required in the visualization data consider rearrangement of the merged facts.
                - If the merged data points has different types of units and missing entities indicate the issue, then remove that data point from merged data.
                - Do not remove data. 
                - Do not introduce new data which cannot find in the provided data. 
                - Do not merge facts if the missing entities create semantic inconsistencies

- Please ensure that all the data in provided input are included in the output and do not remove any.
