    Follow the below guidelines to make accurate output. 

    **Guidelines**
       - All colors in the data points and narratives (in tailwind css) should be a color from "#499F68", "#59C9A5", "#F87171", "#D496A7", "#EDA74B", "#FACC15". If not correct the issue. 
       - Data point colors must be unique. If not assign unique colors from above colors and do the changes in narrative colors as well.  
       - Narrative should not highlight words only parts. If there is only words in a <span> tag remove the highlighting. If it includes numerical value do not remove it.   
       - Text colors in narrative must be consistant with the color in the visualization. If not do the refinement.
       - If there are missing values in the nattive styles correct them. For example, <span class=\"text-[#00ccff] font-semibold p-1 rounded\">6%</span> background color is missing here. 
       - If the visualization type is 'text' then the "value + unit" should be human readable. If not do the proper changes. For example, "value + unit" should look like "1 billion students" not like "1000000 students". 
       - Follow the below example when you are doing style changes. 
       - Do not remove narrative highlights if they are correct.
        
    *** Example ***
        narrative: 'About <span class=\"text-[#00ccff] font-semibold bg-[#00ccff69] pl-1 pr-1 rounded\">6%</span> of private-sector ...'
